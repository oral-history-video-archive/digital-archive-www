<p class="helptext">The Digital Archive is made possible through generous grants from the
  Andrew W. Mellon Foundation titled "The HistoryMakers: The Next Generation" and "The HistoryMakers in Higher Education."
  Initial funding for the work was given by the National Science Foundation, NSF Grant No. IIS-0705491, research project
  "III-CXT: Enhancing Digital Video Libraries through the Evaluation and Transition of Automated Techniques for Visual Processing, Indexing and Access."
  It builds from Carnegie Mellon University "Informedia" research that received funding from a number of sources over the years. The first collaboration between
  The HistoryMakers and Informedia was made possible through the Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS Grant LG-03-03-0048-03.
  The online web Digital Archive benefited greatly from a workshop held at the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) under the direction of Randforce Associates,
  in the UB Technology Incubator. This workshop started off a multi-year beta test of a stand-alone .NET oral history interface with the University of Illinois,
  Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon University, and others.  That work led to an Adobe Flash version of the Digital Archive which was fielded for many years.
  In 2016, Brandeis University spearheaded an effort to update the deployment of the Digital Archive to a broader set of platforms, including mobile, leading to the
  Andrew W. Mellon Foundation support which has produced this version of the Digital Archive. Since 2019, the University of Virginia has led a follow-up effort focusing on higher education.
