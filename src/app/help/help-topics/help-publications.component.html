  The published work is primarily a result of collaboration between The HistoryMakers and the Carnegie Mellon digital video library research team.
  See <a routerLink="/help/ack" routerLinkActive="active">acknowledgments</a> for a description of the early work that led to the HistoryMakers Digital Archive
  and its building from Carnegie Mellon Informedia research and initial IMLS and NSF funding.  These publications were done under those efforts.
  The Digital Archive was in use as an Adobe Flash interface in supporting web browsers from 2008 through 2017, but publications ceased in 2012 with the end of the NSF funding.
  New publications based on the updating of the Digital Archive through Andrew W. Mellon Foundation support are anticipated.
