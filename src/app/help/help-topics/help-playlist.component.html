<p class="helptext">On a story's video playback page, you can mark that story to become part of "My Clips" by
  clicking/tapping the "Add to My Clips" button.</p>
<div fxLayout="column" fxLayoutAlign="space-around center">
  <img fxFlex="0 0 auto" class="help__img" src="assets/help-add-to-my-clips.jpg" alt="Add to My Clips button" />
</div>
<p class="helptext">If the story is already in the local set of clips, you see a "Remove from My Clips" button instead.
  Clicking/tapping that button will remove the story from "My Clips."  Note that "My Clips" is only a local working area on this browser and device.
  If you want to use it on another device or at a different time, you need to save it.</p>

<p class="helptext">
  One way to move a story in "My Clips" to the very last slot is to go to that story's video page,
  click/tap the "Remove from My Clips" button and then the "Add to My Clips" button.
  This removes the story from its old position in the local list of clips and puts it into the last slot.</p>
<p class="helptext">You have access to your workspace, titled "My Clips" in the main routes for the application, at any time.
  Selecting "My Clips" will show you the stories you have marked.
  One main purpose of collecting a set is to then bookmark it for future recollection, or share it so others can make use of this set.
  From the button at the top of the "My Clips" page, which is named "Share My Clips...",
  you select it to then be shown a dialog box where you enter the title for your set of clips.
  On clicking the "copy to clipboard" button in the dialog, that title and the list is now in your clipboard
  which you can then copy into the browser address bar, into email to colleagues, into your own bookmarks bar, etc., to save and share.</p>

<p class="helptext">For example, you looked through stories on baseball and kerosene and are intrigued by two, from Ted Radcliffe and Dorothy Jackson.
  You select the "Add to My Clips" button on each story's page.
  You navigate to "My Clips" and see these two stories in their story set. You select the "Share My Clips..." button and enter a title
  "Baseball and Kerosene."  The result is a link,
  <a [routerLink]="['/stories/6',  {IDList: '8849,12017', ListTitle: 'Baseball and Kerosene'}]"  routerLinkActive="active">example titled set of two stories</a>,
  which is presented in a text format on your clipboard that allows you to paste and go with that link in browsers.  NOTE:
  the character set for saved titles is limited to letters, numbers, dashes, quotes, periods, and spaces.</p>
  <p class="helptext">Also on the "My Clips" page is a button to "Clear My Clips" which lets you remove everything from your local workspace, i.e., "My Clips".
  This is useful when you have multiple sets of stories to work on.
  For example, perhaps you are doing research on 1940s baseball stories and 1960s baseball stories.
  You set up a number of stories in My Clips from the 1940s.  Importantly, you saved this set using the method described above (e.g.,
  after "copy to clipboard" you paste that text link into a text file).  You then clear the local workspace, i.e., "My Clips", using "Clear My Clips" and
  assemble a new list of 1960s stories, and save that set using the copy to clipboard method.
  Again, copy that link to your text file.  If you want to load up either of these sets as your "My Clips", you can do so by using "Clear My Clips",
  then loading the saved route in your text file for the 1940s or 1960s set,
  seeing that there is a button "Add X stories into My Clips" where X is the number of stories shown.
  In this figure, X is 3, i.e., 3 stories in the set.

<p class="helptext">
  You click this button to append those X stories into your "My Clips" set.  Through use of saving your "My Clips" set,
  clearing it, loading up saved lists, and adding those saved lists into "My Clips" you have the ability to assemble, title, save, clear and
  reset groups of stories.
