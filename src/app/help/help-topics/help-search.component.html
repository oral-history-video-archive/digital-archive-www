<p class="helptext-before-list">There are two primary types of searches in the Digital Archive:</p>
<ul class="helptext-no-nargin-top">
    <li class="helptext"><span class="helpEmphasis">1000s of "HistoryMakers"</span>, i.e., the people that were interviewed in the archive.
      From the <a routerLink="/all" routerLinkActive="active">Maker Directory</a> page, you will see a set of HistoryMakers.
      You can issue a search to the biographies and see a resulting set of people.
      You can use <a routerLink="/bioadvs" routerLinkActive="active">
      advanced biography-search</a> capabilities, such as whether to search on just the name.</li>
    <li class="helptext"><span class="helpEmphasis">100,000s of Stories</span>, i.e., what these people spoke about.
      From the <a routerLink="/home" routerLinkActive="active">Home</a> page, you can issue a search and see a resulting set of stories.
      It has its own <a routerLink="/storyadvs" routerLinkActive="active">advanced story-search</a> capability as well.
      Typical searches work against the story transcript (spoken words plus any transcription notes) and story title (created by people to represent the story).
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="helptext" *ngIf="showTopicSearch && tagMatchDetails && tagMatchDetails.length > 0">
