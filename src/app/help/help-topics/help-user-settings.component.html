<p class="helptext">You have two options to reduce the number of clicks or taps you need to watch video stories.  These settings are in the
  <a routerLink="/settings" routerLinkActive="active">user settings page</a>.
</p>
<p class="helptext">
    Auto-play immediately starts a loaded video to play. (This will not work on some mobile browsers, by design of those browsers' video players.)
</p>
<p class="helptext">
    Auto-advance immediately loads the next video in a story sequence from a speaker.  This can be annoying if you are paying attention to the details of a particular story, because the next story will automatically load.
    You can use the browser back button to back up as needed (or turn off the auto-advance option).  If both auto-advance and auto-play are on, you can have a browser page in the background continue to play video, which can be annoying and is why some browsers have turned off auto-play.
</p>
<p class="helptext">These settings may not work on all browsers or platforms.  In particular, auto-play will not work on some mobile browsers.</p>
<p class="helptext">Try out these options when viewing people's stories and see what works best for you.  One common approach on desktops has been to
  leave both unchecked when doing a lot of querying and research.
  When you settle in on a specific person and want to chain through their stories for tens of minutes or longer, you can then navigate to the
  <a routerLink="/settings" routerLinkActive="active">user settings page</a>
  and check both options on.  Use the browser back button to return to the specific person, then select a story to start at.  They will chain with no other click or tap needed.  Return as needed to the
  <a routerLink="/settings" routerLinkActive="active">user settings page</a> to uncheck, i.e., turn off, the automatic play and automatic advance options.
