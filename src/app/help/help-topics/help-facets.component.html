<p class="helptext">Information specialists like to talk about "facets" that are natural categories for filtering down a set of data.  With The HistoryMakers oral history interviews,
  the natural facets for categorization include the gender of the person being interviewed, his or her job family, the "Maker" categorization, and the birth year.
  Because most sets of data would have too many birth years listed, these are collapsed into birth decade.
  See the <a routerLink="/help/facet-origins" routerLinkActive="active">"What are Facets?"</a> help page for details on how facets are produced.
</p>
<p class="helptext mobile-only">
  For mobile (narrow width browsers), click the "Filters"" button in the upper right to bring up a filtering interface.
  The facet groups are listed under a "Refine Results" section at the bottom of the page.
  Tap/click the facet group title to open up a facet of interest.  You will see a count of the number of results within that facet.
  Facets give you a means of immediately seeing the distribution of results across their categorization, e.g., male and female.
  You can click a facet to then drill down to just those results having that facet, e.g., just the women.
  When ready to see the results again, of which you have a count already from this facet interface, click "Close" at the top of the page.
  The facet interface will close, and the results will show.
</p>
<p class="helptext desktop-only">
  For widescreen browsers, look at the filtering interface in a "Filter Results" pane along the left edge of the page.
  The facet groups are listed there.
  Click/tap the facet group title to open up a facet of interest.  You will see a count of the number of results within that facet.
  Facets give you a means of immediately seeing the distribution of results across their categorization, e.g., male and female.
  You can click a facet to then drill down to just those results having that facet, e.g., just the women.
  You immediately see the results of the subset in the right portion of the page.

<p class="helptext">This description says "results" because the result set could be biographies, i.e., the people in the archive.
  Or, the result set could be stories, i.e., what these people speak about.  See <a routerLink="/help/search" routerLinkActive="active">How To Search</a> for more information.

<h2 class="help-heading">Other Notes about Facets</h2>
<ul class="helptext">
    <li class="helptext">Some results may not belong to a facet, e.g., some people that were interviewed did not give a birth date.
      They and their stories will not be part of the "Decade of Birth" facet.</li>
    <li class="helptext">Some facets have a one-to-one mapping with results, e.g., each result is in at most one decade of birth.</li>
    <li class="helptext">Some facets may have a many-to-one mapping with results; a result may have multiple Maker Categories and be in both
      EducationMaker and ScienceMaker for example.</li>
    <li class="helptext">Facets may help with some queries more than others, e.g., a researcher may want to drill down into ReligionMakers, or might
      just wish to watch the count on the ReligionMakers facet change across different queries.
    </li>
    <li class="helptext">
      Some facets may show an overrepresentation or underrepresentation due to The HistoryMakers overall corpus to date, which is growing dynamically
      and may adjust over time.  For example, early interview work concentrated in Chicago and the Illinois area in general.
      As a result, for most query sets, the state "Illinois" will be prominent in the U.S. State facet, because there are so many stories from Chicago.
    </li>
    <li class="helptext">
      Since screen space is limited, not every value within a facet type like "Year" will be listed for any set of results.
      Instead, only the facet values with the highest counts will be shown, much like e-commerce web shopping sites work.
    </li>
    <li class="helptext">
      For U.S. State, there is a "Map" view option so that you can see all 50 states plus D.C. shown on an interactive color-coded
      map and full list so that you can interact with every state. Should this information visualization view prove valuable,
      others may be added to support seeing all the facet values at once for other types like year and decade.
    </li>
    <li class="helptext">Filtering is also possible through some interfaces shown with advanced search options, e.g., to search only certain fields, or
      return only interviews conducted in a certain year range.  See <a routerLink="/help/search" routerLinkActive="active">How To Search</a> for more information.
