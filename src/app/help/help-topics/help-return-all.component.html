<p class="helptext">To see all the stories at once in a story set, you can search with one character, the wildcard matching character asterisk: *.
  By entering just * as a story search string, all the stories are returned.
  This lets you then look at facets to see the distribution of stories across time or geography or categories or gender or other facets.
  See <a routerLink="/help/facets" routerLinkActive="active">How to Use Facets</a> for more information.
