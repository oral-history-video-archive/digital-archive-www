      title: "Blue Veins and Black Bodies: Stories of Policing in America",
      description: "A leading scholar of American criminal justice, Khalil Gibran Muhammad curated a video mixtape on the theme of policing in black America. In brief clips culled from thousands of hours of oral history interviews of some of the nation’s most influential leaders, The HistoryMakers hopes to inspire students, researchers, activists and policy makers to draw wisdom from the past. As state violence and a racial justice movement unfold day-by-day, these remixed stories reveal how blurry is the line between the past and the present, between the North and the South, between justice and peace.",

      title: "The Experience of African Americans in the Field of Classics",
      description: "Brandeis University Associate Professor of Classics Joel Christensen and MA Candidate Zachary Elliott curated a video mixtape on the experience of African Americans in the field of Classics. These videos show the variegated reactions of African Americans to presentations of the history, culture, and literature of Ancient Greece and Rome to begin the process of exploring how to better understand how the presentation of material affects the diversity of the discipline. The videos chosen represent a wide array of reactions to Classics in the life experience of each HistoryMaker. Some remark on the value they received personally from experience in the field. Others draw attention to the racial problems of the field and how the conversation can close out new ideas and productive discussion concerning race. They move from strong statements of the positive personal impact of Classics to equally powerful stories about how the framework of Classics has been and continues to be used to prevent accessibility because of race.",

      title: "Living Intersectional Lives:  Black Women on Race and Gender",
      description: "This mixtape explores the theme of intersectionality in the lives of black women leaders, activists, artists and thinkers.  First coined by black feminist and critical race theorist, Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, intersectionality refers to the ways in which social and political categories such as race, class and gender converge as systems of oppression that contribute to black women’s inequality.  The following stories reveal the complex ways in which black women have negotiated their race and gender as they seek pathways for justice, equality and freedom.",
